# JoomAlphaUserPoints
This plugin integrates [AlphaUserPoints](https://www.alphaplug.com), a very powerful user points system for Joomla, in JoomGallery.

With this plugin users may receive points for commenting, voting, tagging, using the send2friend function, uploading and downloading (for uploading and downloading it's possible to deduct the points, too).

You willl find six XML-files in a subdirectory of the archive called alphauserpoints you have to install manually in AlphaUserPoints (the rules for awarding the points are installed in this way).
